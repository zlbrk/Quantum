*Quantum Transport Simulation Project
---------------------------------------

The main task of this project is to provide a toolset for 1-D 
quantum transport simulation based on transfer-matrix approach.

It is possible to compute current-voltage characteristics 
of the two-electrode tunneling transducer.

Currently implemented with MATLAB technical computing language.
